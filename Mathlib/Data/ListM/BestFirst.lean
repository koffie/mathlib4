# Best first search

We perform best first search of a tree or graph,
where the neighbours of a vertex are provided by a lazy list `α → ListM m α`.

We maintain a priority queue of visited-but-not-exhausted nodes,
and at each step take the next child of the highest priority node in the queue.

This is useful in meta code for searching for solutions in the presence of alternatives.
It can be nice to represent the choices via a lazy list,
so the later choices don't need to be evaluated while we do depth first search on earlier choices.

Options:
* `maxDepth` allows bounding the search depth
* `maxQueued` implements "beam" search,
  by discarding elements from the priority queue when it grows too large
* `removeDuplicates` maintains an `RBSet` of previously visited nodes;
  otherwise if the graph is not a tree nodes may be visited multiple times.

We begin by defining a best-first queue of `ListM`s.
This is a somewhat baroque data structure designed for the application in this file
(and in particularly for the implementation of `rewrite_search`).
If someone would like to generalize appropriately that would be great.

We want to maintain a priority queue of `ListM m β`, each indexed by some `a : α` with a priority.
To complicate matters, the priorities might be expensive to calculate,
so we instead keep track of a lower bound for each such `a : α`.
The priority queue maintains the `ListM m β` in order of the current best lower bound for the
corresponding `a : α`.
When we insert a new `α × ListM m β` into the queue, we have to provide a lower bound,
and we just insert it at a position depending on the estimate.
When it is time to pop a `β` off the queue, we iteratively improve the lower bound for the
front element of the queue, until we decide that either it must be the least element,
or we can exchange it with the second element of the queue and continue.

A `BestFirstQueue prio ε m β maxSize` consists of an `RBMap`,
where the keys are in `BestFirstNode prio ε`
and the values are `ListM m β`.

A `BestFirstNode prio ε` consists of a `key : α` and an estimator `ε : key`.
Here `ε` provides the current best lower bound for `prio key : Thunk ω`.
(The actual priority is hidden behind a `Thunk` to avoid evaluating it, in case it is expensive.)

We ask for the type classes `LinearOrder ω` and `∀ a : α, Estimator (prio a) (ε a)`.
This later typeclass ensures that we can always produce progressively better estimates
for a priority. We also need a `WellFounded` instance to ensure that improving estimates terminates.

This whole structure is designed around the problem of searching rewrite graphs,
prioritising according to edit distances (either between sides of an equation,
or from a goal to a target). Edit distance computations are particularly suited to this design
because the usual algorithm for computing them produces improving lower bounds at each step.

With this design, it is okay if we visit nodes with very large edit distances:
while these would be expensive to compute, we never actually finish the computation
except in cases where the node arrives at the front of the queue.

A lazy list recording the best first search of a graph generated by a function
`f : α → ListM m α`.

We maintain a priority queue of visited-but-not-exhausted nodes,
and at each step take the next child of the highest priority node in the queue.

The option `maxDepth` limits the search depth.

The option `maxQueued` bounds the size of the priority queue,
discarding the lowest priority nodes as needed.
This implements a "beam" search, which may be incomplete but uses bounded memory.

The option `removeDuplicates` keeps an `RBSet` of previously visited nodes.
Otherwise, if the graph is not a tree then nodes will be visited multiple times.

This version allows specifying a custom priority function `prio : α → Thunk ω`
along with estimators `ε : α → Type` equipped with `[∀ a, Estimator (prio a) (ε a)]`
that control the behaviour of the priority queue.
This function returns values `a : α` that have
the lowest possible `prio a` amongst unvisited neighbours of visited nodes,
but lazily estimates these priorities to avoid unnecessary computations.
